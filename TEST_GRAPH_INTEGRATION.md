# Graph RAG Integration Test

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

### What's Been Implemented:

1. **Backend Graph Structure API** (`/graph-rag/graph`):
   - Returns actual Neo4j nodes and relationships
   - Includes publications, entities, and sections
   - Proper graph structure with edges and node properties

2. **React Flow Graph Visualization**:
   - Interactive graph with nodes and edges
   - Different node types: Publications (blue), Entities (green), Sections (orange)
   - Animated edges showing relationships
   - Zoom, pan, and minimap controls
   - Graph statistics overlay

3. **Real-time Integration**:
   - Chat responses now include graph structure
   - Graph visualization updates with each chat response
   - Automatic switching to graph view when data is available

### Features:

- **Node Types**:
  - üìÑ **Publications** (Blue): Research papers with titles and IDs
  - üè∑Ô∏è **Entities** (Green): Key terms and concepts
  - üìã **Sections** (Orange): Paper sections (abstract, introduction, etc.)

- **Relationship Types**:
  - **MENTIONS**: Publication mentions an entity
  - **HAS_SECTION**: Publication has a section

- **Interactive Features**:
  - Drag and drop nodes
  - Zoom in/out
  - Pan around the graph
  - Minimap for navigation
  - Graph statistics display

### How to Test:

1. Start the backend server (port 8000)
2. Start the frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/graph-chat`
4. Ask questions like:
   - "epinephrine surgery"
   - "otolaryngology procedures"
   - "surgical field clarity"

### Expected Behavior:

1. Chat panel shows AI response with entities
2. Graph panel automatically switches to "Graph View"
3. Interactive graph shows:
   - Publication nodes (blue circles)
   - Entity nodes (green circles)
   - Section nodes (orange circles)
   - Animated edges showing relationships
   - Graph statistics in top-left corner

### API Response Structure:

```json
{
  "query": "epinephrine",
  "response": "AI response text...",
  "graph_structure": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "pub_123",
        "label": "Paper Title",
        "type": "publication",
        "color": "#3B82F6",
        "properties": {...}
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "id": "pub_123_mentions_entity_Epinephrine",
        "source": "pub_123",
        "target": "entity_Epinephrine",
        "type": "mentions",
        "color": "#6B7280"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The integration is complete and ready for testing!
